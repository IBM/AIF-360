          "Optimal Transport (OT) is a mathematical problem that was first introduced by Gaspard Monge in 1781. It addresses the task of determining the most efficient method for transporting mass from one distribution to another. In this problem, the cost associated with moving a unit of mass from one position to another is referred to as the ground cost. The primary objective of OT is to minimize the total cost incurred when moving one mass distribution onto another. The optimization problem can be expressed for two distributions $\\mu_s$ and $\\mu_t$ as\n",
          "$$\n",
          "\\min_{\\sigma \\in \\text{Perm}(n)} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\textbf{C}_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n",

          "\n",
          "where $\\textbf{C}_{\\cdot, \\cdot}$ is the ground cost and the constraint $m_{\\#} \\mu_s=\\mu_t$ ensures that $\\mu_s$ is completely transported to $\\mu_t$. Where $T_{\\#} \\mu_s = \\mu_s(T^{-1}(B)) = u_{t}(B)$ with $T$ as a trasportation matrix between $\\mu_s$ and $\\mu_t$ at point $B$. Due to the inherent constraint in the problem, solving Optimal Transport (OT) can be quite challenging. As a result, in practical applications dealing with discrete distributions, a more manageable approach known as a linear program has been employed as a substitute. This approach corresponds to the Kantorovitch formulation, where the original Monge mapping, denoted as $m$ is replaced by a joint distribution represented by an OT matrix.\n",
          "From the optimization problem described above, we can identify two primary components of the OT solution that have practical applications:\n",
          "- The optimal value (Wasserstein distance): This quantifies the similarity between distributions. It is used to measure the dissimilarity or similarity between datasets or distributions. The Wasserstein distance represents the optimal value obtained from solving the OT problem.\n",
          "- The optimal mapping (Monge mapping or OT matrix): This determines the correspondences between the distributions. It describes how the mass is transported between the source and target distributions. The optimal mapping can be utilized to transfer knowledge or information between distributions.\n",

          "In the first case, OT is employed to assess the similarity between distributions or datasets. Here, the Wasserstein distance, which is the optimal value obtained from solving the OT problem, is used as a measure of similarity. In the second case, the focus lies on understanding the specific manner in which mass is transferred between distributions, represented by the mapping. This mapping can be leveraged to facilitate the transfer of knowledge or information between the distributions.\n",

In scenarios where the supports of the distributions are disjoint, OT-based Wasserstein distances offer favorable comparisons to well-known f-divergences such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and Total Variation distance.\n",

For instance, in the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), OT has been utilized to tackle the issue of vanishing gradients, which can hinder the learning process. Additionally, OT has been employed to identify discriminant or robust subspaces within datasets, offering useful insights. Moreover, the Wasserstein distance has found application in measuring similarity between word embeddings of documents, as well as comparing signals or spectra."
